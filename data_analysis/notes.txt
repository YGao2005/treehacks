things I can do with this data:

train machine learning model -> just classify a person as normal or not normal? not normal is exactly what way, maybe that is better.

visualize the graph of their blood differences across time.
- it looks pretty flat to me, I don't quite know really.

let LLM generate if this person is good or not.
- this is deviating if they are putting in effort!!!
